# Mobile User Behavior Prediction App

This **Streamlit** web application predicts user behavior based on mobile usage data. It uses a trained neural network model (ANN) to classify user behavior and display the results with an interactive interface.

## 🛠 Features

- **User Input**: Collects features such as device model, operating system, app usage time, screen on time, and more.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Utilizes a preprocessing pipeline that includes one-hot encoding and scaling.
- **Model Prediction**: Uses a pre-trained artificial neural network (ANN) to predict user behavior class (1-5).
- **Progress Bar**: Displays the predicted class as a colored progress bar based on the behavior class.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for inputting mobile usage data and viewing predictions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you'll need:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Streamlit** for the web interface

### Installation

1. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    ./env/Scripts/activate
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

To run the Streamlit app, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **User Input**: The app prompts users to input features such as the operating system, device model, app usage time, screen on time, etc.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The input features are one-hot encoded, scaled, and transformed before being passed to the model for prediction.
3. **Model Prediction**: The app uses a pre-trained neural network model to classify the user behavior.
4. **Results Display**: The predicted behavior class (ranging from 1 to 5) is shown on the screen, along with a colored progress bar for visual feedback.

## 📊 Model Used

- **Neural Network (ANN)**: The model consists of three layers, including two hidden layers with ReLU activation and an output layer with a softmax activation function for multi-class classification.
- **Model Details**:
- **Input Layer**: Takes features such as app usage time, screen on time, battery drain, and more.
- **Hidden Layers**: Two dense layers with 12 units each and ReLU activation.
- **Output Layer**: A dense layer with 5 units (for 5 behavior classes) and softmax activation.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Train the Model (Optional)
If you'd like to retrain the model, follow these steps:

1. Update the dataset in the `data/` folder (e.g., `user_behavior_dataset.csv`).
2. Run the `train.py` script:
```
python train.py
```

This will retrain the model and save the updated `user_behavior_model.keras` and `scaler.pkl` files in the `model/` folder.

## 🔄 Example
